This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing (HPC) systems effectively. We
obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course in just 3 hours of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and
overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Connect to a HPC cluster
* Use software installed on a cluster through environment modules
* Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler
* Transfer files to/from a cluster
